# /opt/pyvenv (INFO ONLY — not copied)

- Size: 4.7G
- File count: 214941
- Dir count: 28762

Key paths:
- /opt/pyvenv/bin/python
- /opt/pyvenv/bin/pip
- /opt/pyvenv/lib/python3.11/site-packages/

Notes:
- This directory is the main Python virtual environment and is large.
- In this bundle, I include environment metadata (Python version + pip freeze) instead of copying the whole venv.
